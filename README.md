# Supply-Chain-Logistics-Data-Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a Supply Chain Logistics dataset, focusing on data understanding, creation of a data dictionary, identification and analysis of business questions, and the development of predictive models. The goal is to enhance skills in data analytics, critical thinking, and the practical application of machine learning techniques.

## Contents:
### 1.Data Dictionary Document:
Comprehensive documentation detailing the dataset, including content, format, and structure.
Educated assumptions for unclear columns based on industry norms and contextual clues.

### 2.Business Questions and Decision Support Report:
Identification of potential business questions related to inventory management, transportation efficiency, and cost optimization.
Discussion on how insights from these questions can support informed business decisions, such as enhancing supply chain efficiency or reducing operational costs.

### 3.EDA Report:
Detailed report of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for three specific business questions.
Visualizations and insights revealing trends, patterns, and relevant information in the dataset.

### 4.Predictive Models and Performance Analysis:
Model identification based on business questions (regression, classification, clustering, etc.).
Development of models using suitable machine learning techniques.
Documentation of code, methodology, and performance evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, mean squared error, etc.).

## Evaluation Criteria:
